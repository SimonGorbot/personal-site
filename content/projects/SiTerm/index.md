## Project Summary

SiTerm is an adaptor accompanied by a TUI that allows you to interface your laptop via USB to downstream embedded systems and transfer serial messages using I2C, SPI, and UART.
The goal is to have a set of commands that allow you to easily send and read serial protocol messages as an extension to assist with debugging or initial testing of embedded systems.

This is still very much so a work in progress. I'm really trying to find time to work on it between classes and capstone. Never the less, here's some info about the project so far:

- Everything is programmed in Rust.
- I'm using [ratatui.rs](https://ratatui.rs/) for my tui.
- The MCU I'm using as the adapter is the [RP2040-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Zero) board from WaveShare
  - I picked this board specifically because it's tiny, has USB-C, all the peripherals necessary, and the potential to do something cool with [PIO](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/what-is-pio/).
  - Once all the code is complete I might make a shield for even easier connections to downstream embedded systems.
- I'm using the [Embassy framework](https://embassy.dev/) for my firmware.  
- The name of the project comes from an abbreviated form of **S**erial **I**nterface **Term**inal. It's also the first two letters of my name **Si**mon **Term**inal.
- There's a lot of unused code in the project currently because I started from a template. I'm in the process of trimming all of it out.

## Command List

All commands follow the general format: `protocol action payload`. Payloads are action specific depending on the command you are writting.

### I2C

#### Leader

##### Single Byte Read

 Protocol  | Action  | Payload                            | Example                        | Complete |
